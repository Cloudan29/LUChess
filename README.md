# LU Chess

Discord bot for Laurentian University Chess Club (not yet founded)
Could possibly reconfigure for use outside. 

# Plans

## Tournament Creation

This bot will have the ability to create tournaments regularly depending on configuration (or hard coded for testing/if we can't figure it out)

## Notifications

When tournaments are created or nearly started, will have the capability to ping everyone (or possibly a group) about the tournament. 

## Tournament Imports

With lichess, importing tournament files is possible, this will hopefully be a feature, such that when tournaments are done, the tournament PGN and game tables will be able to be imported. This can be used for analysis.
